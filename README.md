# Zaza-Website
A repo for the development of the Zaza Ecosystem Website

v0.0.1
-  Exact figma design. Purple background, single page long.
-  Single iframe added.
-  "Sign up" and "Join Waitlist" buttons added

v0.1.0
-  Orange/pink color focused (intially, it's a gradient that fades into purple).
-  More content, albeit unordered, haphazard and too little to flesh out the site.
-  Added button and card hover animations.
-  Made the UI responsive.
-  X-axis overflow issue. Cause currently unknown.
-  Added email capture form.
-  Added white bakcground footer. Some color change is definitely in mind, black didn't seem to suit the theme of the website.

v0.2.0
-  Implemented the parallax effect and a placeholder background image.
-  Switched to rounded card type sections for the layout. 95% opaque to show the parallax effect more.
-  Added a solid white background color to the header and footer to cover the background parallax effect image.
