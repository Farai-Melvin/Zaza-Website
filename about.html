      <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Greg - founder of Zaza, learning scientist, and long-time education reform advocate. I started Zaza because I’ve seen too many teachers - my sister, cousins, aunties, and close friends included - sacrificing their nights and weekends building lesson plans, marking student work, and juggling admin they’re barely paid for. I knew there had to be a better way.
With a PhD in Professional Education and more than 20 years’ experience leading learning strategies across Australia and Europe, I’ve dedicated my career to helping educators and organisations adapt to the future of learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently serve as Group Director of Learning at Communardo, where I lead AI-powered education transformation. But Zaza is something deeply personal.
I grew up in Tasmania, Australia, and now live in Germany with my wife - a PhD in Organisational Psychology - and our two daughters. One is finishing school and dreaming of her gap year in Australia. The other is still in school, plays the French horn, and keeps us all active with her sporty energy.
Zaza was inspired not just by need, but by possibility. When I saw what other AI-first apps like Cal.AI were doing in health, I realised the same could - and should - be done for education. Why not give educators their time back, without compromising pedagogy?
That’s why we built Zaza Teach: an AI-powered lesson planner that respects real classroom needs. No fluff. No hallucinations. Just structured, differentiated, exportable lessons in under a minute. And it’s just the beginning.
Zaza is growing into a full ecosystem - with tools not only for teachers, but also for students, tutors, and even young learners. Our goal? Empower educators to focus on what matters most: just teach.
Thanks for being here. Let’s build something that truly matters.
– Greg
